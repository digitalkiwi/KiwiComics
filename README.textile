h2. Why you should contribute

It's a fun experience and the perfect choice for learning objective-c and the iPhone API.
It's semi-famous with over 10.000 "downloads a month":http://apt.modmyrepo.com/index.php?action=packagestats&package=KiwiComics .
You have total control as the license gives you permission to fork your own code if you are not happy with my decisions.

h2. How to start programming for KiwiComics

1. Install xcode and the iPhone API (3.0 or above) and see to it that it can "program for jailbroken iphones.":http://www.alexwhittemore.com/?p=270
2. Install git and create a github account to "fork KiwiComics":http://help.github.com/forking/ the original version. 
3. Code away!
4. Send the changes back to me or "release it yourself":http://www.saurik.com/id/7

h2. License

As long as you don’t make money on my code and also link to my webpage in your app, you are free to fork my code to make your own reader. My hope is that there will be more free iphone manga readers out there because of this.
